# -4-Axis-Open-Loop-Serial-Robotic-Manipulator
The project was focused on the mechatronic design of a 4 axis stepper motor-based robotic manipulator.  It featured 4 Nema 17 stepper motors, 4 rotational joints, it had a working envelope of around 25cm. The robot is customizable and reporgrammable for different tasks.  The project focused on the mechanical design and rigidity of the robot, aswell as the control and kinematic design and balancing of the joints. The forward and inverse kinematic model of the system was solved and applied to the system.
